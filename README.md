# Usage

 * Add the unix timestamp when you want the event to occur
 * Multiple timestamps can be added by seperating them by a comma

# Example

```
1646850609,
1646850409,
1646850519
```

# Note

 * Any timestamps set must be at least 300 seconds (5 minutes) from the current time or the event may not trigger
